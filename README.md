# ICES Course

This repository contains model files and associated material for the 2023 ICES course on Stock Synthesis held in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The preferred method of working with this repository is to clone it to your personal machine. 

However, if you can't download R and RStudio or VSCode (both are IDEs to work with R in) or are having other technical issues, then there is the option to use the repository as a template, create your own GitHub repository based on this one, and spin up a codespace with R and r4ss loaded. You **must** create your own repository using this one as a template to save your work in your own GitHub repo, otherwise, it will be deleted.
