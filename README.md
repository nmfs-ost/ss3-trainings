# SS3 Codespace Template

This is a codespace template to get set up with the latest [Stock Synthesis executable](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/releases/download/v3.30.21/ss_linux), and downloads associated R packages ([r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) and [ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim)) on a Linux machine using the latest R version. This template also downloads the user-example model files and moves stock synthesis executables to each of the model folders.

- Open a terminal in the codespace and navigate to a model directory using ```cd model_file/insert_model_name_here```
- Use command `./ss` to run model
- Open a R terminal to use r4ss with the models
- The base directory for this codespace is /workspaces/ICES-SS3-Codespace if you need to go back.
