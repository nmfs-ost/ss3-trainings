# ICES Course

This repository contains model files and associated material for the 2023 ICES course on Stock Synthesis held in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

The preferred method of working with this repository is to clone or download it to your personal machine. To clone the repository, go to the <> Code button, Local tab, and copy the git link to clone using Git or your preferred IDE (VSCode, RStudio, etc.). The other option is to Download Zip under the Local tab which includes all of the repository files. 

However, if you can't download R and RStudio or VSCode (both are IDEs to work with R in) or are having other technical issues, then there is the option to use the repository as a template, create your own GitHub repository based on this one, and spin up a codespace with R and necessary packages (r4ss, ss3diags, etc.) loaded. You **must** create your own repository using this one as a template to save your work in your own GitHub repo, otherwise, it will be deleted.
