# ICES Course

This repository contains model files and associated material for the 2023 ICES course on Stock Synthesis held in Copenhagen, Denmark.

A .devcontainer is also available to use the repository as a template and spin up a codespace with R and r4ss loaded. Creating your own repository using this one as a template will allow you to save your work in your own GitHub repo, otherwise, it will be deleted.
